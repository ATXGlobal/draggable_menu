# 2.0.1 Release
- `fastDrag` issue debug

# Changes in 2.0.0 Release
- Fixed some issues by changing its movement logic
- Added new status to the Draggable Menu. Now you can detect whether the Menu will do the "expand, minimize and close" gestures.

*If you are coming from an early version before the 1.0.0 of the `draggable_menu`, check out the version 1.0.0 changes before using the `2.0.0` version.*
